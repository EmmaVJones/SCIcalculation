# VSCIcalculationForOtherDatasets
This repository holds scripts to calculate the Virginia Stream Condition Indexes, the VSCI and VCPMI, from data outside the ODS environment. The scripts offer an in depth walk through on the old Access database version of EDAS such that users can mimic the data structure for their own datasets. Download the lastest copy of EDAS here: https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Programs/Water/WaterQualityInformationTMDLs/WaterQualityMonitoring/ProbabilisticMonitoring/ProbMonDataSources.aspx

EDAS was moved into a centralized DEQ data environment in Summer 2020, so all new data are no longer available in Access EDAS. Please contact Emma Jones (emma.jones@deq.virginia.gov) and Jason Hill (jason.hill@deq.virginia.gov) for recent data queries or to obtain a copy of the /data directory required to run these scripts.

The VSCIcalculationForDrew.Rmd walks users through the process of pulling data from a central data source or from local data sources and allows users to run all three SCI scores on input data.
